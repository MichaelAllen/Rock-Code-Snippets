# About These Notes

These are mainly notes I have created for internal use. I am sharing them here in the hope that they may be helpful for someone, but I make no promises that they are error-free.

If you have a question about any of these files, feel free to reach out to me on [Rocket Chat](https://chat.rockrms.org) @michaelallen.

## Finding Things

### Folder Structure

Each snippet is in a folder for the domain of Rock that it relates to. (Similar to the structure used here [here](https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock/tree/develop/RockWeb/Blocks))

### Tag Types

Each file should be tagged with one or more tags from each of the categories below to make it easier to find what you are looking for.

- **language/??** - What language is used in this snippet?
- **type/** - What is the primary function of this snippet?
    - **cleanup** - Clean up bad/duplicate/old data
    - **reporting** - Return information
    - **utility** - Make a task easier
- **topic/??** - What are some topics that the snippet relates to? Primarily to help with searching.

If you want to browse by tags, you can visit the [[Tags|Tag Index]]. You can also use tags in the search box above.

## Disclaimer

Never run code you found online, unless you read it and understand what it is doing. That is a great way to have a bad day.

This site is auto synced from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) on my computer to [Github](https://github.com/MichaelAllen/Rock-Code-Snippets). It is then automatically compiled into a website using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).
