# Readme

This repository is best viewed in a tool like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that can read the metadata tags and present the notes in a somewhat organized matter. Otherwise, good luck finding what you're looking for in a flat folder full of markdown files. ðŸ˜…

If you have a question about any of these files, feel free to reach out to me on [Rocket Chat](https://chat.rockrms.org) @michaelallen. I am usually quick to respond.

## Tag Types

Each file should be tagged with one or more tags from each of the categories below to make it easier to find what you are looking for.

- **language/??** - What language is used in this snippet?
- **domain/??** - What domain of Rock does this snippet tie into? (Based on the list [here](https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock/tree/develop/RockWeb/Blocks))
- **type/** - What is the primary function of this snippet?
    - **cleanup** - Clean up bad/duplicate/old data
    - **reporting** - Return information
    - **utility** - Make a task easier

## Disclaimer

These are mainly notes I have created for internal use. I am sharing them here in the hope that they may be helpful for someone, but I make no promises that they are error-free.

Never run code you found online, unless you read it and understand what it is doing. That is a great way to have a bad day.
